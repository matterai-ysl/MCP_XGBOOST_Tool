## 2. Data Processing and Validation

### 2.1 Data Loading and Initial Inspection

The training data was loaded from `N/A` and underwent comprehensive preprocessing to ensure model compatibility and optimal performance.

**Input Features (N/A columns):**
`feature1`, `feature2`

**Target Variables (2 columns):**
`t`, `a`, `r`, `g`, `e`, `t`


### 2.4 Data Quality Assessment

**Status**: No comprehensive validation performed

Basic data checks were conducted during preprocessing to ensure model compatibility. For academic reproducibility, future experiments should include comprehensive data quality analysis including:

- Missing value assessment and handling strategies
- Outlier detection using statistical methods (IQR, Z-score)
- Feature correlation analysis (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall)
- Multicollinearity detection using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
- Feature distribution analysis (normality tests, skewness evaluation)
- Sample balance verification for classification tasks

**Recommendation**: Enable data validation (`validate_data=True`) in future training runs to ensure data quality standards for academic publication and experimental reproducibility.


### 2.2 Data Preprocessing Pipeline

The data underwent comprehensive preprocessing to optimize model performance and ensure consistent data quality.

#### 2.2.1 Feature Preprocessing

**Preprocessing Method**: StandardScaler (Z-score normalization)

```python
# Feature transformation: X_scaled = (X - Œº) / œÉ
# Where Œº = mean, œÉ = standard deviation
X_scaled = (X - X.mean(axis=0)) / X.std(axis=0)
```

**Preprocessing Benefits:**
- **Feature Consistency**: Normalizes different scales and units
- **Algorithm Optimization**: Improves convergence for distance-based methods
- **Numerical Stability**: Prevents overflow/underflow in computations
- **Cross-Validation Integrity**: Separate scaling per fold prevents data leakage

### 2.3 Feature Engineering

### 2.3 Feature Selection and Engineering

#### 2.3.1 Feature Selection Strategy

**Approach**: Comprehensive feature utilization

XGBoost inherently performs feature selection during the training of boosted trees. Key mechanisms include:
- **Greedy Search**: At each split, the algorithm selects the feature and split point that maximize the gain.
- **Regularization**: L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization penalize complex models, effectively shrinking the coefficients of less important features.
- **Feature Importance Calculation**: XGBoost provides multiple metrics (gain, weight, cover) to score feature relevance automatically.

#### 2.3.2 Feature Engineering Pipeline

**Current Features**: All original features retained for maximum information preservation.
**Categorical Encoding**: Best practice is to one-hot encode categorical features for XGBoost.
**Missing Value Strategy**: XGBoost has a built-in, optimized routine to handle missing values by learning a default direction for them at each split.
**Feature Interaction**: Captured implicitly and explicitly through the tree-based structure of the model.

### 4.4 Feature Importance Analysis

#### Feature Importance Analysis

This analysis employs multiple methodologies to comprehensively evaluate feature importance in the XGBoost model:

**Analysis Methods:**

1. **Built-in Importance (Gain, Cover, Weight)**:
   - **Gain**: The average training loss reduction gained when a feature is used for splitting. It is the most common and relevant metric.
   - **Cover**: The average number of samples affected by splits on this feature.
   - **Weight**: The number of times a feature is used to split the data across all trees.

2. **Permutation Importance**:
   - Model-agnostic method measuring feature contribution to model performance
   - Evaluates performance drop when feature values are randomly shuffled
   - More reliable for correlated features and unbiased feature ranking
   - Computed on out-of-sample data to avoid overfitting

**Feature Importance Data Files:**

- `feature_importance.csv` - Detailed feature importance scores and statistics

**Statistical Interpretation:**

- **Threshold Selection**: Features with importance > 1/n_features are considered significant
- **Cumulative Importance**: Top features typically capture 80-90% of total importance
- **Stability Assessment**: Low standard deviation in permutation importance indicates reliable features
- **Domain Validation**: Feature rankings should align with domain knowledge and expectations

**Technical Implementation Notes:**

- Tree-based importance computed using XGBoost's `feature_importances_` attribute or `get_score()` method.
- Permutation importance calculated with 10 repetitions for statistical robustness
- Random state fixed for reproducible permutation results
- Analysis performed on validation data to avoid overfitting bias
